# 1Dviralmodel


Modeling viral spread with various parameters on a 1-D population taking random walks. Likelihood of random walk is altered based on quarantine status and among simulations. Also introduced are places more likely to return too (i.e. supermarkets). Curves similar to SIR model depending on the tunable parameters.
